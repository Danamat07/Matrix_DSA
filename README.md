# Matrix_DSA
ADT Matrix – represented as a sparse matrix with tuples of the form (row, column, value) (value ≠ 0), where the tuples are stored in lexicographical order by (row, column) in a binary search tree (BST) with a linked representation and dynamic allocation. The project includes both short and extended tests.

This project implements an ADT Matrix in C++, represented as a sparse matrix using tuples of the form (row, column, value) where the value is not equal to zero. The matrix is stored in a binary search tree (BST), with the tuples arranged in lexicographical order by (row, column). The tree uses a linked representation with dynamic allocation.

NOTE: The code for this project can be found on the master branch.
